# Wrap It Up

After everything you learned, you are now able to create a Dockerfile with all depencencies you need, assemble an image from it that you can share via Docker Hub or .tar file and launch a container from it. I took the time and wrote a Dockerfile with widely used packages in scientific computing that can be found [here](./Dockerfile). If you need additional packages, just add them to the Dockerfile as explained in the previous chapters. I also made the image from this Dockerfile [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/brenerrr/base_scientific/general).


That's it. I hope you find this collection of tutorials useful and if you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to open a new issue.
